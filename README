NOTE: We strongly recommend you to look at the user's manual and installation instruction document in Marimba's folder. Such documents contain more detailed information than this README file.

Marimba is a model checker for hidden Markov models (HMMs) whose specification language is the logic POCTL* [4,5]. Marimba is also the name of a musical instrument popular in southeast Mexico and Central America, it is similar to a xylophone.

Our model checker, i.e., Marimba, is coded in Haskell and consists of six modules: 

-Courcoubetis.hs
-DirectApproach.hs
-Lexer.hs
-Main.hs
-ModelChecker.hs
-Parser.hs

How to use Marimba
Marimba starts by loading the Main.hs module that contains the function main, which is called to start the model checker. Next, some GNU licensing text is shown, as well as the sentence: Enter the file name where the HMM is located. as is shown below. The program now waits for a .hmm file to be passed to it.

Enter the file name where the HMM is located.
=====================================================================


The six elements of an HMM have to be defined within a .hmm file. We use the reserved words: States, Transitions, Observations, ObsProb, Labelling and Initial, to define the set of states, the transition probability matrix, the set of observations, the observation probability matrix, the labelling function and the initial distribution, respectively. Moreover, in the .hmm file the sets of states and observations are given as integer numbers representing their size, the probability matrices for the state transitions and the observation distributions are expressed as lists of lists of double values, the labelling function is a list of lists of strings (letters only), and the initial distribution is a list of double values. We require the definition of the number of states (identified by the reserved word States) to be the first element defined within the .hmm file. Likewise, the number of observations (an integer identified by the reserved word Observations) has to be defined before the observation probability matrix. Apart from these two constraints, the rest of the HMM elements can be defined regardless of their position within the .hmm file. For example, consider the ModelChef.hmm file found in the examples folder, and depicted below. This model is defined in detail in Chapter 1 of [1], and describes a chef's mood variations with time where the main courses he or she cooks are considered as observations of the HMM.

=====================================================================
States = 2

Transitions = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]

Labelling = [["c"],["d"]]

Observations = 3

ObsProb = [[0.5, 0.3, 0.2], 
           [0.1, 0.6, 0.3]]

Initial = [0.6, 0.4]
=====================================================================

Observe that in this case the set of states is {1, 2}. In general, if States = n, the set of states is {1, 2, ..., n}. Likewise, if Observations = m, the set of observations is {1, 2, ..., m}. When asked for a file where an HMM is located, we might answer 

'Enter the file name where the HMM is located.
examples/ModelChef.hmm'


Then, Marimba asks: 'Would you like to consider each state as if it were the initial state, i.e., as if it had initial distribution value equal to 1? y/n:'. If the answer is 'y', Marimba regards each state as if it were the one the system starts from, and computes the probability of satisfaction accordingly. If the answer is 'n', Marimba computes the probability of satisfaction of each state by taking into account the likelihood that such a state is initially chosen as specified by the initial distribution. Let us say that we answer this question with 'y'.

Next, the model checker requests a POCTL* state formula by printing

'Enter the POCTL* formula we are interested in.'


To type POCTL* formulas, we associate to each grammar's terminal symbol a natural encoding as shown below:

==== Terminal Symbol ====	==== New encoding ====
Boolean value true		Reserved letter T
Boolean value false		Reserved letter F
Atomic proposition		Sequence of non-reserved letters
Negation operator 		Symbol ~
Disjunction operator		Reserved letter v
Conjunction operator		Symbol ^
Probabilistic operator		P[@ p], where P is a reserved letter
Next operator			X_{m1,...,mi}, where X is a reserved letter
Bounded until operator		U n, where U is a reserved letter
Unbounded until operator	Reserved letter U
Left parenthesis		Symbol (
Right parenthesis		Symbol )
======================================================


Observe that,
-The encoding of the comparison symbol @ can take any of the values <, <=, >= or >.
-For the threshold double value p used by the probabilistic operator, the inequality 0 <= p <= 1 holds.
-Since we are considering the observations as integer numbers from 1 to the value of Observations defined in ModelChef.hmm, every element in the subset of observations {m_1,...,m_i}, attached to the next operator, also lies within this interval.
-The bound n used in the bounded until operator is a non-negative integer.

Thus, when asked for a formula to verify, we might type:

'Enter the POCTL* formula we are interested in.
P[>= 0.3]((d ^ ~X_{1}T) U 10 (c ^ X_{1}T))'

which indicates that with probability at least 0.3 the chef will be upset up to the day he/she cooks steak, such a day could be today or any of the next ten days (see the example located in Subsection 2.4 of the user's manual for further details).

The model checking algorithm is executed on the already passed HMM and this POCTL* formula. If the specification involves the probabilistic operator, Marimba prints an intermediate result in parentheses consisting of a list with the probabilities of each state satisfying the argument of the probabilistic operator. Finally, Marimba returns the list of states satisfying the input formula. The output for the particular HMM and POCTL* formula given above is:

=====================================================================
The states that satisfy it are:
(Probability of satisfaction of each state: [0.5,0.39047935101157205])
[1,2]
=====================================================================

Therefore, states 1 and 2 of the HMM defined in ModelChef.hmm satisfy the given formula.

Afterwards, Marimba asks whether the user wants to keep verifying properties on this same model. It prints: 'Do you want to continue checking more specifications? y/n:'. If the answer is 'y', the program waits for a new formula to be entered. If we respond with an 'n', the tool finishes.



EXAMPLES
In the examples folder enclosed with the Marimba's source code we find several instances of hidden Markov models and POCTL* specifications that were verified with our tool. Thorough explanations are given in the user's manual.
